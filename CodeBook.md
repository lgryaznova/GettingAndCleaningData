1  |  Subject | The person who performed the activity for each window sample.
2  |  Activity | Activity performed by the subject at the moment the signal was captured.
3  |  tBodyAccMeanX | Time domain signal. Mean value of the body acceleration signals on the 'X' axis. Signals are captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz, filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise, then  applying another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
4  |  tBodyAccMeanY | Time domain signal. Mean value of the body acceleration signals on the 'Y' axis. Signals are captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz, filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise, then  applying another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
5  |  tBodyAccMeanZ | Time domain signal. Mean value of the body acceleration signals on the 'Z' axis.

6  |  tBodyAccStdX | Time domain signal. Standard deviation for the body acceleration signals on the 'X' axis. Signals are captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz, filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise, then  applying another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
